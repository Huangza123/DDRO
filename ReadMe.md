1. Code for Data-Driven Robust Optimization Neural Network Method for Imbalanced Data Classification
2. APPLICATION, KEEL, and MNIST-CIFAR10 for application test, keel test, and imbalanced mnist and cifar10 test, respectively.
3. To perform the KEEL test, cd to the KEEL/datasetdataset_name/, then run train_xxx.py.
4. Similar operation is used for the application test and MNIST-CIFAR10 test.
