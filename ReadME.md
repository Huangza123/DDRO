Code for Data-Driven Robust Optimization Neural Network Method for Imbalanced Data Classification

APPLICATION, KEEL, and MNIST-CIFAR10 folds serve for application test, keel test, and imbalanced mnist and cifar10 test, respectively.

To perform the KEEL test, cd to the KEEL/datasetdataset_name/ , then run train_xxx.py.

Similar operation can be achieved by application test and MNIST-CIFAR10 test.
